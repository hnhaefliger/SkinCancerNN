SkinCancerNN
============

This repository makes use of neural networks in keras to classify skin cancers into two categories: benign and malignant

The training file contains the code for creating and training the network while the demo file contains code for a sample run on the test images in the 'cancers' folder

The network was trained on the "skin cancer: malignant vs benign" dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign)

Training was done on google colab on GPU and the network achieved about 86% test accuracy in 15 minutes
